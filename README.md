# Overview

Currently, this project serves as a way to further my  understanding of the Kotlin language and for understanding how to manipulate images.
The program can open images in the png format, crop them, convert them to 2 bits, and the crowning feature: overlay another image that has transparency.
It is designed to go behind objects in the image.

# Development Environment

Coded in Kotlin using IntelliJ IDEA by Jetbrains.
This project uses the Scrimage library for opening pngs.
You can find out more about this library [here.](https://sksamuel.github.io/scrimage/)

# Future Work

* Obviously this needs a better user interface. I would love to bring it to Android.
* There is a bug when you try and both convert it to two bits and crop it.
* Would like to add the feature of adding a border to the image.
